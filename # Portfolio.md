# Data Visualization Portfolio for PPOL 6902-02

## Welcome to my portfolio for the Data Visualization (PPOL 6902-02) class, taught by Professor Joe Wesley. This repository is organized into three sections:
1. A data story that delves into Nigerian conflicts, showcasing insights derived from a detailed analysis.
2. Original data visualizations created to explore patterns in African conflicts.
3. Replications of textbook visualizations, demonstrating my ability to recreate professional-grade charts.

For the first two sections, I primarily utilized the Social Conflict Analysis Database (SCAD), the most comprehensive dataset on conflicts in Africa, to generate meaningful and visually engaging insights.

## Section 1: Data Story - A Deeper Look into Nigerian Security Landscape

### Introduction
Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa with over 200 million people, is rich in diversity, resources, and culture. As the second-largest economy on the continent, Nigeria plays a pivotal role in Africa's economic narrative, driven by its vast mineral and oil resources. However, Nigeria also faces significant challenges, being one of the most conflict-prone nations in the region. This data story delves deeper into Nigeria's security landscape to provide a detailed analysis.

### Key Insights
1️⃣ If Not Government Conflict, Then What?

Nigeria has experienced the highest number of conflicts in Africa, according to the Social Conflict Analysis Database (SCAD) Africa 2018 dataset.

Overall Conflicts vs. Government-Targeted Conflicts:
Both conflict types have dramatically increased since 2010.
However, government-targeted conflicts have not risen proportionally to the overall trend.

2️⃣ Non-State Conflicts: Frequency and Fatalities

Using the UNDP Non-state Conflict Dataset, we can analyze the frequency and fatality of non-state conflicts in Nigeria. The graph indicates a significant rise in non-state conflicts post-2010. Although the UNDP data captures an increase in the frequency of these conflicts, it does not show a radical rise. However, by plotting the highest estimated fatalities for each year, we find that the conflicts between 1999 and 2004 were the deadliest.

3️⃣ Who Are the Main Parties in Non-State Conflicts?
Now that we have established the significant impact of non-state conflicts on Nigerian security, one might ask: Who is involved in these conflicts? The accompanying graph, which uses a black background for emphasis, utilizes the UNDP dataset to identify the two main parties in each non-state conflict from 1995 to 2022. The size of the letters indicates the frequency of their involvement in conflicts. The results show that the Christian Yoruba, Muslim Hausa, and Tiv ethnic groups were predominantly engaged.

Black Axe, originally a Nigerian fraternity founded in 1977 that evolved into an organized crime group, and Eyie—meaning 'bird' in Yoruba—also initially a student cofraternity, have become prominent players. These findings align with the subsequent waffle chart. By categorizing non-state conflicts into three types—paramilitary, political, and ethnic—we observe that from 2015 to 2022, the majority, if not all, of the conflicts in Nigeria were ethnic in nature.

## Section 2: Nine Original Visualizations (in reverse order)

## Original 09
The goal of this visualization is to depict the frequency and intensity of government-targeted conflicts in five African states (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Nigeria, Somalia, and South Africa) from 1990 to 2018. The heatmap uses varying shades of blue to represent the number of conflicts, with darker shades indicating higher conflict intensity. It highlights extended periods of conflict in specific countries, such as Nigeria and South Africa, while also allowing for a comparative view of conflict trends across the selected nations and years.

## Original 08 
The visualization represents the number of conflicts in African countries, grouped by regions (Western, Northern, Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa) in a treemap format. The size of each country’s block corresponds to the relative number of conflicts it has experienced from 1990 to 2018, highlighting countries with the highest conflict counts, such as Nigeria in Western Africa and South Africa in Southern Africa. This layout allows for an intuitive comparison of conflict prevalence both within and across regions.

## Original 07
The visualization aims to illustrate the duration of government-targeted conflicts in Africa from 1990 to 2018, showing how long conflicts tend to last over the years. The main finding is that the majority of conflicts terminate within 25 days, indicating a trend of relatively short-lived government-targeted conflicts.

## Original 06
Original 6 compares the cases of conflict in Nigeria and Mali at the same time. 
It shows that even though Mali has a higher percentage of conflict targeting the central government, overall conflict has been higher in Nigeria over the years.

## Original 05
Based on the Original 4 visualization, Original 5 also examines the total conflict in Mali from 1990 to
2022 and compares its frequency to conflicts targeting the central government. It shows that the
percentage of conflicts targeting the central government is higher than that of Nigeria in Mali.

## Original 04
From the third original visualization, it was found that Nigeria had extended years of government-targeted conflict. 
This visualization demonstrates two bar graphs that contain the total number of conflicts and mark how much of the conflict was
government targeted. It proves a relative proportion of the government-targeted conflict.

## Original 03
The graph maps the government-targeted conflict of each country in Africa from 1980 to 2018. The visualization
delivers which countries had sustained government-targeted conflicts and differentiates them by color and intensity of color.

## Original 02 
The purpose of this data visualization is to demonstrate a correlation between the number of
fatalities caused by the non-state conflict in Sudan, the most conflict-ridden country in Sub-Saharan
Africa, from 1987 to 2022. Combining the three types of non-state conflict (paramilitary, political
conflict, and identity-based conflict), the visualization shows that the higher the number of disputes
is, the number of deaths tends to be higher, except in 1993 when the highest number of deaths
despite near-average conflicts. This discrepancy yields further areas of examination.
