The purpose of this data visualization is to demonstrate a correlation between the number of
fatalities caused by the non-state conflict in Sudan, the most conflict-ridden country in Sub-Saharan
Africa, from 1987 to 2022. Combining the three types of non-state conflict (paramilitary, political
conflict, and identity-based conflict), the visualization shows that the higher the number of disputes
is, the number of deaths tends to be higher, except in 1993 when the highest number of deaths
despite near average conflicts. This discrepancy yields further areas of examination.
