## Original 08 
The visualization represents the number of conflicts in African countries, grouped by regions (Western, Northern, Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa) in a treemap format. The size of each countryâ€™s block corresponds to the relative number of conflicts it has experienced from 1990 to 2018, highlighting countries with the highest conflict counts, such as Nigeria in Western Africa and South Africa in Southern Africa. This layout allows for an intuitive comparison of conflict prevalence both within and across regions.

## Original 07
The visualization aims to illustrate the duration of government-targeted conflicts in Africa from 1990 to 2018, showing how long conflicts tend to last over the years. The main finding is that the majority of conflicts terminate within 25 days, indicating a trend of relatively short-lived government-targeted conflicts.

## Original 06
Original 6 compares the cases of conflict in Nigeria and Mali at the same time. 
It shows that even though Mali has a higher percentage of conflict targeting the central government, overall conflict has been higher in Nigeria over the years.

## Original 05
Based on the Original 4 visualization, Original 5 also examines the total conflict in Mali from 1990 to
2022 and compares its frequency to conflicts targeting the central government. It shows that the
percentage of conflicts targeting the central government is higher than that of Nigeria in Mali.

## Original 04
From the third original visualization, it was found that Nigeria had extended years of government-targeted conflict. 
This visualization demonstrates two bar graphs that contain the total number of conflicts and mark how much of the conflict was
government targeted. It proves a relative proportion of the government-targeted conflict.

## Original 03
The graph maps the government-targeted conflict of each country in Africa from 1980 to 2018. The visualization
delivers which countries had sustained government-targeted conflicts and differentiates them by color and intensity of color.

## Original 02 
The purpose of this data visualization is to demonstrate a correlation between the number of
fatalities caused by the non-state conflict in Sudan, the most conflict-ridden country in Sub-Saharan
Africa, from 1987 to 2022. Combining the three types of non-state conflict (paramilitary, political
conflict, and identity-based conflict), the visualization shows that the higher the number of disputes
is, the number of deaths tends to be higher, except in 1993 when the highest number of deaths
despite near-average conflicts. This discrepancy yields further areas of examination.
